### Terraform Commands & Outputs

#### `terraform init`

<details>
<summary>command-output</summary>

```
kokai@kokai:~/Desktop/S25-core-course-labs/terraform/docker$ terraform init
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding kreuzwerker/docker versions matching "~> 3.0.2"...
- Installing kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2...
- Installed kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2 (self-signed, key ID BD080C4571C6104C)
Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html
Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the last "terraform apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # docker_container.moscow_time_app has been deleted
  - resource "docker_container" "moscow_time_app" {
      - id                                          = "ebf3a244147f1479aa19af57483ab561063ace082587852d2211eefd1b61f28d" -> null

        # (16 unchanged attributes hidden)

        # (1 unchanged block hidden)
    }


Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include
actions to undo or respond to these changes.

## Yandex Cloud
I created a service account in Yandex Cloud with admin permissions.
Generated a secure key (key.json) for authentication, avoiding hardcoding credentials.
Used this key in Terraform and CLI to manage resources programmatically and securely. The hardest part for me was the UI—it wasn’t very intuitive, and I struggled to assign myself an admin role.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

## Best Practices

### Secrets Management
- **Sensitive data** such as API tokens and private environment variables were **never hardcoded**.
- Used **environment variables** and `.env` files to reference secrets.
- These files were **excluded from version control** via a properly configured `.gitignore`.

### Code Formatting and Validation
- `terraform fmt` was consistently used to **enforce standard code formatting**.
- `terraform validate` was run before every execution to **verify syntax** and **catch configuration errors early**.

### Planning and State Management
- `terraform plan` was used before each `terraform apply` to **preview infrastructure changes** and prevent unintended modifications.
- `terraform state list` and `terraform state show` were used prior to destroying any resource to **inspect and confirm** state details.

### Resource Importing
- Existing infrastructure components were **imported** using `terraform import` to avoid resource recreation and to bring them under Terraform management seamlessly.

### Version Locking
- **Terraform CLI version** and **provider versions** were explicitly defined using constraints to **avoid unexpected updates or breaking changes**.

### Naming and Structure
- The configuration files followed **Terraform best practices**:
  - `main.tf` for providers and core logic
  - `variables.tf` for input variables
  - `outputs.tf` for declared outputs

### Version Control Hygiene
- `.gitignore` was configured to **exclude**:
  - `.terraform/` directories
  - local state files (`*.tfstate`, `*.tfstate.backup`)
  - `.env` and other system- or user-specific files
